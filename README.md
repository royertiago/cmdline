cmdline - simple command line argument parser
=============================================

This is a simplified command line parser with `bash`-like syntax.
It was written mainly to ease the task of using multiple subcommands,
in projects like <https://github.com/royertiago/porrinha>.

For intended usage, see the unit tests in
<https://github.com/royertiago/cmdline-test>.
